## Color Schemes
I used [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/mythemes) and [EightShapes Contrast](https://contrast-grid.eightshapes.com/) to determine the primary color for the background and text on the website. 

## Design / Existing Features
The website is created based on the initial design on the large desktop size. Then add the media queries to make it responsive on different media screen sizes from 320px up to 2300px. All of pages are re-sized accordingly.

### Navigation Header

  * All three pages have the same logo and nativation menu on the top of the website. Logo "Super Cars" on the left, navigation links "Home, Our Stock and Contact" in the middle and the a graphic logo on the right.

  * The navigation header clearly shows the user where to find the relevant information around the website. ![Header]('assets/images/header.avif')
