### Design Choice

* Color Scheme
  
    I used **Adobe Colors** and **EightShapes Contrast** to determine the primary color for the background and the text on the website. I select the black background for the website and white color for the text for the maximum contrasts with the screenshots chosen.  

    ![Color theme](assets/screenshots/colortheme.jpg)


    ![Color contrast grid](assets/screenshots/contrastgrid.jpg)

  The fonts chosen on the website are Lato for the body text that it's easy to read. The fall back fonts are "Open Sans" and sans-serif. The font used for the logo is fantasy chosed on the option list that provides a great contrast to the page text.

      * Performance Score

        The initial scores were between 73% - 92% due to the render-blocking resources found such as cumulative layout shift and largest contentful paint.

        * Deleted empty spaces both on html and css file. 

      * Accessibility Score

        The initial scores were between 92% - 96% due to some minor issues that the background and foreground contrast, the font size for small screens, and the headings' order. 

      * To improve the accessibility score

        * Changed the background color of “commitment list” for better contrast with the text color. 
        * Increased the font-size to ensure the readability on small screens. 
        * Added a h3 heading to the gallery page to make the headings in a sequentially descending order. 
        * Adjusted the header element to avoid the elements overlapping on small screens.
