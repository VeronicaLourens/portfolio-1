### Lighthouse Testing

The website has been tested on Chrome Incognito window using dev tools for both mobile and desktop. 

* Desktop

  ![Result for the desktop](assets/images/lghthousescr.jpg)

* Mobile

  ![Result for the mobile](assets/images/lghthousescr1.jpg)

* Performance Score

  * The initial scores were 73% on the home page, 87% on the gallery page and 92% on the contact page due to the render-blocking resources found such as cumulative layout shift, largest contentful paint, large size of images, large size of css file and images were not set an explicit width and height.

  * To improve the performance score

    I used the online free image compression tools to compress all the images in the image folder. First I converted the png format to avif format but it didn’t work well so that I converted the images to jpg format and replaced all images on three pages with compressed jpg images. I also created a new media css file and placed the media query css code to a separate media css file. Deleted  empty spaces both on html and css file. 

* Accessibility Score

  * The initial accessibility scores were between 92% - 96% due to the background and foreground contrast ratio issues. The font size was set to less than 12px.  The heading element on the gallery page was not in sequentially descending order. 

  * To improve the accessibility score

    I changed the background color of “commitment list” on the home page to darker blue background for better contrast with the text color.  Increased the font-size on the media query styling to ensure the readability on small screens. I added an section with a h3 heading to the gallery page in order to make the headings in a sequentially descending order. Adjusted the header element to avoid the elements overlapping on small screens. 

* Best Practices Score

  * The initial score was 98% for all of the three pages. There was no major issues. The score went up to 100% during improvements made on other parts of testing.

* SEO Score

  * SEO was initially 97% on all three pages due to the typo on the HTML footer element. I corrected the typo on the social media links “noopenner” to “noopener”. The score was improved to 100%.

### Testing on screens
I tested that the website is fully responsive on desktop, laptop, iPad and mobile phone. Initially, it worked well on the desktop, laptop and iPad. However, it only displayed the top parts of the site on my phone due to the site couldn't be scrolled down to see the rest of the site. I assumed that the rest of the site was blocked for whatever reason. It did work on landscape mode on my phone when I turned my phone sideways. It works well after ajusting the CSS code. 

### Testing on the browsers
I have tested that the Super Cars website is accessible on different browsers. It works well on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Mozilla Firefox. The website is fully responsive on devices with different screen sizes while using different browsers. The Super Cars website loads fast on different browers.



### Known Errors

 * W3C HTML Validation - Two errors and one warning found.

## Limitation

* The contact details on the page such as address, phone number and email address cannot be actually used due to they are created only for display purpose with no actual functions.

* The contact form on the Contact page cannot be stored any data and sent actual messages because there is no actual functionality of the form. The form attributes are deleted in HTML file to avoid any error.

* There might be minor issues regarding English grammer or typo on the content of the website.

## Credit & Acknowledgement

* Whilst I have tried to deviate as much as possible, there might be some similarities in the code as the Super Cars project was influenced by the code along Love Running project at [Code Institute]().

* I relied upon the support from Code Institue [Tutors]() and mentor [Precious Ijege](), Slack community and my families. Thanks to all those who support my learning journey. I use W3schools, MDN web docs and stack overflow for general references throughout the project.

* The [Super Cars](https://veronicalourens.github.io/supercars/) website is intended for education purpose of completing the Portfolio Project 1 for the Diploma of Full Stack Software Development course at [Code Institue]().
