The website intends to target people who are interested in buying high speed top brand luxurious cars. The site offeres exclusive information about the company and a range of cars available to attract site visitors to purchase their dream car.

## Planning Stage
Made a few sketches on the paper to put my ideas on display. Looked for some information about the Lamborghini and Bugatti cars online.

## User Story
* As a first time user, I want the website to be easily accessible on different devices and work on different browsers.

* As a first time user, I want to easily navigate around the page for getting to know what the site is about.

* As a returning user, the name of website should be easy to type and remember. The images need to be high quality and the text should be easy to read.

## Site Owner Story
* To target the luxurious car buyers, the website must be responsive on different media screen sizes.

* The site shoud have a great collection of high quality photos of premiium cars with different nodels to attact site users to return.

* The content on the website should be easy to load and offer an easy way to navigate around the site where users can easily find a huge range of cars.

* The site uses top quality photos and short description to present the simple yet attactive inviting messages.

## Color Schemes
I used *Adobe Color* and *EightShapes Contrast*to determine the primary color for the background and text on the website. 

## Design / Existing Features
The website is created based on the initial design on the large desktop size. Then add the media queries to make it responsive on different media screen sizes from 320px up to 2300px. All of pages are re-sized accordingly.

### Navigation Header

  * All three pages have the same logo and nativation menu on the top of the website. Logo "Super Cars" on the left, navigation links "Home, Our Stock and Contact" in the middle and the a graphic logo on the right.

  * The navigation header clearly shows the user where to find the relevant information around the website.
